	<h3>About This Website</h3>
	<p>This website was constructed for several reasons.  One, it has been a lot of fun to work on.  Two, I'm tired of not having a personal website to link to on LinkedIn, github, etc.  Being a programmer myself, I didn't want to rely on a blog somewhere to be my site.  Furthermore, having started several blogs before, I never seem to keep up with them for very long.  This is far more entertaining.  Three, to show that I do indeed know more than SQL and MDX.  Lastly, I'm going to finish setting up this website with a video upload module for all of my family's movies so that we can watch them anywhere.  And yes, I know there are plenty of site that offer that service, but where's the fun in that?

	<p>This website was constructed using the mean.js boilerplate code as an architecting platform.  I installed it on an old desktop computer I set up with Debian.  It was fun to build it all through the command line, as that isn't something I have messed around with much before.  I'm getting two more old desktops from a family member who no longer needs them, and I am hoping to chain them together and build a single virtual server on top of them.  In a sense, this project has been about familiarizing myself with angularJS, other popular JS frameworks, but it has also been an  infrastructure project.  It has been really helpful to me in improving my understanding of all of the elements of the full-stack javascript framework, and also in understanding how to set up a public-facing website, end-to-end.  Its also been fun working with all of these open-source technologies after being in the Microsoft stack for a while.
